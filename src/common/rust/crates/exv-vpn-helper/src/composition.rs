//! Deterministic helper control-plane composition (Architecture spec L1012/L1052/L1054/L1056/
//! L1057/L1079/L1099/L1120).
//!
//! PURE, deterministic: the composition is a pure state machine over the frozen
//! `exv-vpn-domain` (identity/ports), `exv-vpn-resource` (RetirementSaga), and
//! `exv-vpn-data-plane` (TeardownBarrier) primitives. Ownership is acquired, the packet data
//! plane is attached and frame-gated by the held ownership version, and a clean retirement only
//! releases ownership once BOTH the teardown barrier (both sides joined) and the durable
//! RetirementSaga (Retired) have completed.
