// EXV R31-T: effect scheduling, stale disposition, and host-lost for exv-vpn-runtime.
// These tests define and pin the actor contract that R31-I must implement in
// `exv_vpn_runtime::actor`. The actor is the runtime's single writer: it consumes
// `RuntimeCommand`s (bounded mailbox from R30), calls `Reducer::reduce(state, command,
// inputs)`, schedules the resulting fenced `RuntimeEffect`s (each a fenced effect task), and
// routes `EffectCompleted` completions back carrying their `CompletionFence` and
// `StaleDisposition`. They are expected to be RED until R31-I implements `actor::RuntimeActor`.
//
// The actor contract is FROZEN BY THESE TESTS. R31-I must implement EXACTLY in
// `exv_vpn_runtime::actor`:
//   - `RuntimeActor::new(limits: &MvpLimits, scheduler: Arc<dyn EffectScheduler>)`
//   - `RuntimeActor::from_state(limits, scheduler, initial: RuntimeState)`
//   - `RuntimeActor::submit(&self, command: RuntimeCommand)`      // enqueue a normal command
//   - `RuntimeActor::complete_effect(&self, completion: EffectCompletion)` // enqueue a completion
//   - `RuntimeActor::pump(&self)`  // drain inboxes synchronously: run reducer, schedule effects
//     (spawn fenced effect tasks), route completions; MUST release the single-writer lock before
//     any effect task runs and NOT hold it across an effect.
//   - `RuntimeActor::state(&self) -> RuntimeState`                // committed-state snapshot
//   - `RuntimeActor::inflight_effects(&self) -> usize`            // scheduled-not-yet-consumed
//   - `RuntimeActor::inflight_fences(&self) -> Vec<CompletionFence>`
//   - `RuntimeActor::try_lock(&self) -> Option<ActorLockGuard<'_>>` // single-writer lock probe
//   - `RuntimeActor::register_late_handle(&self, ref_: EphemeralCleanupRef, cleanup: LateCleanup)`
//     where `type LateCleanup = Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>`
//   - `RuntimeActor::late_handle_consumed(&self, ref_: &EphemeralCleanupRef) -> bool`
// plus `pub trait EffectScheduler: Send + Sync { fn schedule(&self, effect: RuntimeEffect); }`
// and `pub struct ActorLockGuard<'a>`.
//
// Stale-completion semantics (the actor's own responsibility, independent of the reducer):
//   - `ProvenNoEffect`            -> discard: no state change, no effect, no recovery.
//   - `AcquiredEphemeralResource` -> consume the registered cleanup token (ephemeral close),
//     and for a protocol/packet late handle, close+join it (protocol) or detach+reconcile (packet).
//   - `JournaledExternalEffect`   -> request reconcile (enter `Reconciling`).
//   - `UnknownResourceAcquisition`-> enter recovery (enter `Reconciling`).
// A completion fenced to a runtime epoch that predates the current epoch is REJECTED (never
// consumed, never applied). On `HostLost` the actor revokes data admission and begins a teardown.
//
// These tests are killable by the three R31 mutants:
//   (a) discard the late TLS handle instead of close+join -> late_tls_handle_is_closed_and_joined
//       fails (the closed/joined flags are never set).
//   (b) completion channel permanently below Stop priority -> stop_flood_still_services_completion
//       fails (a stop flood starves the pending completion, inflight_effects() stays nonzero).
//   (c) effect task directly modifies state -> actor_is_only_state_writer fails (the committed
//       state changes without the actor's sole write path).
// Determinism comes from `tokio::time::pause()` and explicit `tokio::sync::Notify` gates; the
// tests NEVER sleep.
