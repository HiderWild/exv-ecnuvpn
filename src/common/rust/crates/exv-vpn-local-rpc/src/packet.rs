//! Helper-side packet adapter (spec L1011/L1012/L1296/L1300/L1301/L1363, TG-06).
//!
//! Binds a one-shot packet capability to the attached peer, rejects a second attach,
//! refuses an expired / cross-principal / cross-connection capability, gates teardown
//! on BOTH sides actually joining the barrier, refuses `release` until the barrier is
//! released AND the retirement CleanProof is clean, and admits data-plane frames only
//! for the current ownership version. PURE + deterministic: no I/O, no sleep, no
//! randomness.
