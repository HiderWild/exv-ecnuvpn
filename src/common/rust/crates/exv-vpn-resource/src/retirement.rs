//! Durable retirement lifecycle + scoped CleanProof saga (Architecture spec §7.5,
//! crash rules L1202-L1207).
//!
//! PURE, deterministic, no I/O. Durability is a surrogate: [`RetirementSaga::begin`] seals a
//! J51 `MutationAdmitted` (kind Retirement, `JournalOperationIdentity::Retirement`,
//! `AuthorizationSubject::RecoveryAuthority`) and round-trips it through the J51 codec,
//! requiring reproduction of the exact [`RetirementOperationId`]. The ordered phases
//! (Pending → Started → Observed → Proved → Retired) enforce the crash rules: destructive
//! cleanup is only grantable after the retirement is durably started for the exact internal
//! identity, a CleanProof is only issued against a complete re-verified inventory, and the next
//! ownership version only advances once ownership is durably retired.
