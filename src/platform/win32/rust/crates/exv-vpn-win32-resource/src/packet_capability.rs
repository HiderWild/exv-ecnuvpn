//! Single-use packet-boundary capability (W23B-I).
//!
//! [`PacketCapability`] is the pure capability/fact record of a pending
//! packet-boundary attach: it binds a [`PacketLeaseRef`] to the
//! [`RuntimeEpoch`] that issued it and is consumed exactly once by the atomic
//! `Pending(capability) -> Attached(connection_id)` transition that the
//! helper's `AttachedPacketRelay::attach` executes (the `packet_relay`
//! contract, spec §5.5). Concurrent or repeated use of an already-consumed
//! capability
//! is rejected with [`ErrorCode::PacketLeaseAlreadyAttached`] and a consumed
//! capability is never reused (spec §9.2). No Win32 calls: the capability
//! owner lives in this resource crate and this module is pure logic over the
//! lease/epoch facts.
