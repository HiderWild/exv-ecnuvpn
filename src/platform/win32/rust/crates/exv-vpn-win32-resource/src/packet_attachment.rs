//! Packet-boundary attachment record (W23B-I).
//!
//! [`PacketAttachment`] is the pure record produced by the atomic attach
//! transition: it links one relay leg (the stream that won the race for a
//! single-use [`PacketCapability`](crate::packet_capability::PacketCapability))
//! to a packet channel leg, carrying the winner's `connection_id` and the
//! packet lease the capability granted. The `packet_relay` contract pins
//! `Clone/Debug/PartialEq/Eq` plus `connection_id`/`lease` accessors; the
//! record is immutable once created. No Win32 calls: pure data over the
//! attach facts.
