//! Startup recovery over the durable journal + native observation (W25-I).
//!
//! Architecture §5.1: the platform resource owner acquires the exclusive
//! mutation authority BEFORE scanning the journal or the native state (W13
//! order: lock first, then scan) — the engine holds the [`SingletonAuthority`]
//! until recovery completes. §7.4 crash rules: a torn/incomplete admission is
//! not an admission; a corrupt middle journal is `Corrupt` — never skipped, no
//! proof; a durable `MutationAdmitted` with no terminal outcome is observed
//! first, never replayed. §7.5: destructive cleanup is granted only by a
//! durable `RecoveryAuthority(RetirementOperationId)` — a prior token or its
//! digest never authorizes — and a same-name resource whose fingerprint
//! diverges is a typed skip, never deleted by name.
//!
//! The engine composes the committed leaf pieces — W14 projection
//! ([`crate::journal_projection`] over the W14 store) and the J51 admission
//! codec — without re-implementing them, and never executes or replays an
//! apply.
