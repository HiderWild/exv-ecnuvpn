//! A joinable packet worker thread (W17).
//!
//! The packet worker is the helper abstraction a session uses to poll
//! `WintunReceivePacket` on a dedicated thread. The frozen safety order
//! (native-wintun-facts.md §2 `child.joined_before_session_end`) requires the
//! worker to be joined **before** `WintunEndSession`: 0.14.1's `WintunEndSession`
//! destroys the session object, so any `WintunReceivePacket` after end is a
//! use-after-free (measured ntdll AV). [`PacketWorker`] guarantees the join by
//! doing it both on explicit [`PacketWorker::join`] and in `Drop`, so a session
//! that holds a worker cannot end before the worker thread has stopped.

/// thread's loop, the closure is only ever called on that one thread, and
/// [`PacketWorker::join`] / `Drop` block until the thread has stopped before
/// the worker (and thus the carrier) is dropped. The caller must therefore
/// ensure the closure's captures are not concurrently shared with other
/// threads for the worker's lifetime — the frozen WSP3 receive-poller pattern
/// (e.g. a session-managed event handle held for the worker's lifetime, with
/// the join-before-session-end order guaranteeing the handle stays valid).
/// This mirrors the reviewed `unsafe impl Send` of `crate::wintun_session::WintunSession`:
/// the wrapped state is only ever touched from one thread at a time under the
/// wrapper's own lifetime rules.
