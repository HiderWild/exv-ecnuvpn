//! A received Wintun packet buffer (W17).
//!
//! `WintunReceivePacket` returns a pointer into the session's receive ring;
//! that outstanding receive must be released with `WintunReleaseReceivePacket`
//! (frozen fact `receive.outstanding_released`, native-wintun-facts.md §2).
//! [`WintunPacket`] owns the outstanding receive and releases it in `Drop`, so
//! dropping a packet *is* the release — a receive ring of ~1024 slots is never
//! exhausted by callers that drop what they receive (kills the
//! 'received packet buffer never released' mutant).
