//! Orderly shutdown of the privileged helper composition (W26-I).

//! composition order (W17/W24 join-before-final 的进程级投影): the native workers
//! the helper started are JOINED first — never detached — and the authority/final
//! handle is released only after every join completed (架构 §6.2/§6.3: 不允许 detach
//! 未知 worker)。
