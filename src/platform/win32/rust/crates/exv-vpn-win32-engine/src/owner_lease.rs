//! Per-connection ownership lease manager (W15).
//!
//! Owns a J52 delivery slot plus the live per-connection lease handles. A lease is held from the
//! moment a token is issued until the token is acknowledged or the connection terminates; a held
//! lease exposes a monotonic expiry deadline, and an absent/resolved lease exposes none. A
//! restarted manager has no memory of prior tokens: a fresh issue requires a fresh auth path and
//! mints a fresh token.
