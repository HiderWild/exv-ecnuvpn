//! Packet-boundary relay legs: atomic attach + running proof (W23B-I).
//!
//! [`AttachedPacketRelay`] is the `W23B-T` frozen seam of the helper crate.
//! It composes, WITHOUT re-implementing:
//! - the resource crate's single-use [`PacketCapability`] /
//!   [`PacketAttachment`] (the atomic `Pending(capability) ->
//!   Attached(connection_id)` transition, spec §5.5; the capability owner
//!   lives in the resource crate and `attach` executes its consume exactly
//!   once);
//! - the W23A [`PacketChannel`] (X71H ownership-version sequence and queue
//!   budget — the relay never re-implements budget/sequence);
//! - the W17 [`WintunSession`] ring (receive/send/read-wait event), injected
//!   by the host for the send leg's writes.
//!
//! The relay itself is a pure per-leg state machine per direction
//! (`Attached -> Running -> Terminal`); it never spawns threads. Frozen WSP3
//! facts honored here: `pump_send_frame` uses the fixed lock order (relay
//! lock -> session lock), and the `EndSession` safety order (packet workers
//! JOIN before `WintunEndSession`) is owned by [`WintunSession`]'s `Drop` —
//! the relay only writes the send ring, it never ends the session.
