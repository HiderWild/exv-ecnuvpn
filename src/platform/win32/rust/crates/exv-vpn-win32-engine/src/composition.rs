//! Privileged helper process composition (W26-I).
//!
//! [`compose_privileged_helper`] builds the [`HelperComposition`] by composing the
//! committed leaf pieces — W13 [`SingletonAuthority`], W14 [`JournalPath`] /
//! [`JournalProjection`], W15 [`MutationIngress`], W25 [`RecoveryEngine`] — in the
//! frozen startup order (架构 §5.1: 先 lock 后 scan；endpoint publication 是最后一步):
//!
//! 1. acquire the exclusive mutation authority FIRST
//!    ([`CompositionPhase::AuthorityAcquired`]); a WAIT_TIMEOUT loser returns
//!    [`ComposeError::AuthorityBusy`] before any scan/observe/publish (WSP2 §1);
//! 2. run startup recovery over the durable journal under the authority
//!    ([`CompositionPhase::RecoveryCompleted`]); only a corrupt projection
//!    ([`ComposeError::RecoveryCorrupt`]) or a native failure
//!    ([`ComposeError::Recovery`]) blocks endpoint publication — every other
//!    outcome completes recovery (Pending 也算完成);
//! 3. publish the endpoint LAST ([`CompositionPhase::EndpointPublished`]) — the
//!    composition's authenticated ingress is the helper's only mutation surface.
//!
//! Any failure path releases the acquired authority before returning: the failed
//! compose leaves no state behind.
//!
//! The W22/W24 aggregate/teardown machinery activates when the W28 vertical slice
//! starts real Wintun workers; this pure composition records the worker count
//! (zero) it actually started, and shutdown joins exactly that many.
