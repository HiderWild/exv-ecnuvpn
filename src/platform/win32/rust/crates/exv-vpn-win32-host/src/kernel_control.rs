//! `KernelControl` gate: controller transport peer auth before any secret conversion (W27-I).
//!
//! The gate admits `KernelControl` commands through the host pipe. Authorization
//! is strictly first (X71K: secret decode before controller auth is a mutant)
//! and fails closed: an unauthorized secret conversion is refused with no
//! dispatch side effects. Secrets are moved into a [`ClearableSecret`] slot
//! that zeroes its contents on `clear` and on drop — `KernelControl` command
//! secrets must never linger in host memory.
