//! Sequence-ordered, budgeted admission for one leg of the packet boundary (W23A-I).
//!
//! The channel pairs a Q60 [`PacketBudget`] (per-batch and queue-budget admission, built from
//! the [`PacketLimits`]) with a Q61 [`PumpScheduler`] (fair directional alternation, spec
//! §8.5), and stamps every admitted batch with a strictly increasing X71H ownership-version
//! sequence so stale owned frames can be refused.
